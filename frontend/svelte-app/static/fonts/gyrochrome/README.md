# Gyrochrome

![Sample of Gyrochrome](documentation/image1.png)

Gyrochrome is a rounded, geometric sans-serif derived from Vernon Adams'
[Michroma](https://github.com/vernnobile/Michroma-font).

Specifically, it is derived from the [Google Fonts version
1.100](https://github.com/googlefonts/Michroma-font) released on May 25,
2023 by Emma Marichal. While that version, unlike Adams' original, does not
identify "Michroma" as a Reserved Font Name, this derived font is different
enough from the original (not only in style, but in the design and
composition of some characters) that it seemed more in the spirit of the
OFL to give it a new name and make it clear that any quality issues with
the font should be laid at my door, not theirs.

This font exists because I needed a font "of the rounded-square sans genre
that is closely associated with a 1960s feeling of the future" (as Adams
described the original Michroma), in the tradition of Eurostile and
Microgramma, for a design project, but in a rounded style; I had no budget;
and I had a Glyphs 3 license. If you find it useful, I'm happy, but if you
can afford a real typographer you should definitely hire one.

Gyrochrome is available in six weights, from Regular (400) to Heavy (900).
